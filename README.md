# AmazonHomepageClone
I have created a simple yet impressive Amazon Clone using only HTML and CSS. I have recreated the main elements of the Amazon homepage and gained a solid understanding of how these components came together to create the website. Hope it helps.

To create an Amazon-inspired Homepage Clone using only HTML and CSS, follow these step-by-step instructions:

Create a folder. You can name this folder whatever you want, and inside this folder, create the mentioned files.
Create an index.html file. The file name must be index and its extension .html
Create a style.css file. The file name must be style and its extension .css
Download and place the Images folder in your project directory. This folder includes the Amazon logo, hero background image, and shopping card images.
To start, add the following HTML codes to your index.html file: These codes include navigation (nav), sections, input fields, links, and various other tags necessary for your Amazon clone webpage.
